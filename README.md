GTF Monte Carlo Simulation

Developed a Monte Carlo Simulation based on the Georgia Tech Foundation overall Portfolio values. 
I plan on adding another simulation with a breakdown based on Asset Class.

Initial Values: 
  Portfolio Annual Return: 4.8%
  Portfolio Annual Return: 11.0%
 
 The simulation was run with a monthly period, 120 month duration, and 100,000 simulations.
